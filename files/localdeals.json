Based on a legendary 12th-century Persian poem, it tells the allegorical story of a flock of birds, who set off on a treacherous quest to find the legendary phoenix- like creature that represents the Divine. With Hoopoe the wise one leading the way, they follow a painful but beautiful path toward realization of the Sufi idea of transcendent totality. First staged in 1971 with Helen Mirren in the lead role, \"The Conference of the Birds\" was written by Tony-winning director Peter Brook and acclaimed French novelist Jean-Claude Carriere, who based their script on real conversations with villagers living along the Sahara from Algiers to Nigeria, resulting in a powerfully simple work that sheds stale Western conventions to get at theater's universal truths.",
