The Nobel Prize-winning author of  Cheri ,  Duo  and, most famously,  Gigi , which was adapted into the blockbuster 1958 film directed by Hollywood maverick Vincente Minnelli, Colette was also an environmentalist and an ardent feminist whose progressive beliefs (particularly as they pertained to sexual liberation) made her a willing enemy of polite society. Actress Lorri Holt ( Patch Adams ) brings Colette to vivid life on stage, providing an overview of the writer's life while displaying her extraordinary gifts for storytelling, social commentary and humor. Come find out for yourself why the  The San Francisco Examiner  raved, \"It's immediately clear how effortlessly this consummate actress channels early-20th-century French novelist Colette . Holt simply embodies the rebellious character in all her (ever-so-French) self-confidence, vulnerability and sensual charm. \"",

    "dealinfo": "Following the unabashed and uncensored tradition of his acclaimed solo shows  Ghetto Klown  and  Freak , Emmy and Obie Award winner John Leguizamo brings his latest personal venture  Latin History for Morons  to Peet's Theatre at Berkeley Rep, where he'll break down 3,000 years of cultural history into 90 minutes of irreverent comedy and outrageousness. Filled with Leguizamo's trademark humor, the piece follows the performer's attempt to educate his own son (as well as the audience) about the marginalization of Latinos throughout US history, while also emphasizing the significant roles they have played in the foundation of America. From a satirical rundown of the Aztec and Incan empires to vivid accounts of Latin patriots in the Revolutionary and Civil War, Leguizamo's cultural crash course is equal parts eye-opening and hysterical.",

Set amidst the showy decadence of the 1920s,  Chicago  tells the tale of convicted murderers Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, who'll stop at nothing to get the attention of the press and celebrity attorney Billy Flynn. Their malicious crimes turn them into media darlings, producing a barrage of sensational headlines, the likes of which could just as easily be ripped from today's tabloids. A smash on Broadway (winning six Tony Awards) and on the big screen (winning six Academy Awards), this biting satire features the unforgettable songs of Kander and Ebb, including \"All That Jazz,\" \"Cell Block Tango\" and many more hits.",
