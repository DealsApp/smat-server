But the change of settings does nothing to diminish the play's appeal -- indeed, if anything, this update enhances the shock and power of the original. In this brilliant adaptation by writer-director Basab Pradhan, Nora becomes Naina, a capable and educated woman who has chosen to be a homemaker in what appears to be an ideal South Asian marriage. But is she  really  an equal in her own home? Ibsen's explorations of family roles, gender expectations and power dynamics are more relevant than ever in this retelling of a classic . which one day may become a classic in its own right.",
